# Shortest-Routes-System-C-
This C++ program gives the shortest routes between the two locations according to their respective distance by taking user input of source and destination name. Moreover, there is a developer's sign in option as well to rename any location or add a new location and link it with any other locations.

This project is implemented using Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Object Oriented Programming.

This program is Implemented using:
1) Graph(Adjacency Matrix for Larger Data) with pairs(Distances, Traffic Status).
2) Hashmap to store indices of location on Adjacency Matrix with respect to their Name (key).
3) Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate the minimum distances between the Routes.
